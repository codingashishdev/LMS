## Command Palette

The app includes a global command palette powered by `cmdk`:

- Open with `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux) or `âŒ˜+K` (macOS)
- Quick open with `/` when not focused in an input field
- Search for pages and actions, then hit `Enter` to navigate/execute

The palette is mounted once globally in `app/layout.tsx` and can also be opened via the header buttons in both the marketing header and dashboard header.
